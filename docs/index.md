# WiD Hackathon

Working website to code and solve problem for women's safety using data. 
The data will be hosted in the Snowflake environment. The data will be 
anonymous and will be used solely for the 
purpose of the hack.

In partnership with Women in Data, UK, non-profit and Impactic Volunteers

** Safety Data Requirements **

Using the safety survey data, propose exploring the following six categories:

1. **Public Crimes Data:**
   - Crimes reported by the police or the MET, broken down by region.

2. **Public Services Data:**
   - Data related to travel services and public amenities like hospitals and police stations, broken down by region.

3. **Tribunal Data on Workplace Grievances:**
   - Data on public court cases related to workplace grievances.

4. **Public Court Cases on Other Crimes:**
   - Data on public court cases related to crimes other than workplace grievances.

5. **Mumsnet Chat Data:**
   - Mumsnet is a popular online platform based in the UK that serves as a 
     community and discussion forum for parents. 

6. **Socio-demographic and Household Information:**
   - Information on socio-demographics and households, broken down by region.

More Metrics data at postcode level and The Ark's data at household level 
could complement the raw data we have. They can provide aggregated datasets at a higher geographic level.

**Key Information from More Metrics **
- More Metrics Documentation: [More Metrics Documentation](https://www.moremetrics.co.uk/documentation-hub)
- The Ark's Household Data: [The Ark Household Data](https://www.ark-data.co.uk/the-uk-household-file/)
- Free Samples on Snowflake:
  - More Metrics: [More Metrics on Snowflake](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/providers/GZ1MOZCFPI/More%20Metrics)
  - The Ark: [The Ark on Snowflake](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/providers/GZSVZ8TNPJ/The%20Ark)

The demographic information includes household income, individual income differentiated by sex and age, self-reported health, disability, smoking, obesity, attitudinal indices, and the Index of Multiple Deprivation.

**Tasks:**
Participants are encouraged to:

1. **Explore Datasets:** Utilize datasets that pertain 
   to women's safety. This could include information on demographics, 
   medical records, disease prevalence, treatment outcomes, etc.
2. **Analyze and Visualize:** Analyze the data to identify trends, 
   patterns, and potential areas for improvement in women's safety. 
   Visualize key insights to better understand the data.
3. **Develop Solutions:** Propose innovative solutions, which could be in 
   the form of applications, predictive models, educational tools, or any 
   other technological advancement that addresses specific challenges in 
   women's safety.
4. **Pitch and Demonstrate:** Present the findings and developed solutions 
   to a panel of judges, explaining the rationale, methodology, and 
   potential impact of the proposed solution.

**Tools and Resources:**
 Participants are encouraged to use open-source tools, libraries, and 
 technologies for data analysis, such as Python (Pandas, NumPy), R, Jupyter 
 Notebooks, machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow), 
 visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn, GeoPandas), and any other 
 open-source resources available.

**Note:** This hackathon aims to create a collaborative environment 
where participants can learn, innovate, and contribute to a meaningful 
cause in women's safety. The aim of the hackathon is not to be a 
competition but a supportive and caring environment working on sensitive data 
that can be triggering.
