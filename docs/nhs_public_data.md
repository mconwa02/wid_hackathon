Following discussions at Health SteerCo about the hackathon event in March,
below the link to the open source datasets relating to prescription data. 
It's useful for health questions in relation to things like 
self-prescribing pain relief by gender and looking at where the data is 
highlighting issues with access to proper advice and GP prescribing for menopause etc.

It may be that a question could be devised for the hackers
that combines use of the datasets above and some 
commercial/retail data, such as via the basket analysis project

# Community Prescribing & Dispensing

Datasets on the prescribing and dispensing of medicines in the community.

## 1. Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) Annual Statistics
The PCA release is an Official Statistic with National Statistic designation.
The lowest granularity of data in the publication for both financial and 
calendar year is added here. PCA contains information on all prescription 
items dispensed in England and submitted to the NHSBSA for reimbursement.

The full statistical release, including more information on what the 
statistics contain, can be found on our website and you can specifically 
read the Prescription Cost Analysis Background Information and Methodology 
to understand more about the data.

## 2. Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) Monthly Administrative Data
PCA contains information on all prescriptions items dispensed in the community 
in England on a monthly basis and submitted to the NHSBSA for reimbursement.

This data mirrors the methodology used in the PCA Annual National Statistics
publication. The latest statistical release, along with more information on 
what PCA contains, can be found on the NHSBSA website and you can specifically 
read the Prescription Cost Analysis Background Information and Methodology.
The monthly PCA release is a monthly management information data set and is not
an Official Statistic.

Data for February 2008 to March 2021 is available on the [NHSBSA website](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/prescription-data/dispensing-data/prescription-cost-analysis-pca-data) in a
legacy format.

## 3. English Prescribing Dataset (EPD)
This dataset contains information on prescriptions issued in England that 
have been dispensed in England, Wales, Scotland, Guernsey, Alderney, 
Jersey, and the Isle of Man.

The dataset combines elements of the Detailed Prescribing Information (DPI)
data previously released by NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) via 
the Information Services Portal, and the Practice Level Prescribing in 
England (PLP) data released by NHS Digital via their website. It is 
intended to replace both of those sources.

These datasets have been brought together to provide end users with a 
single comprehensive, consistent and accessible source of prescribing information.

## 4. Hospital Prescribing Dispensed in the Community
We have worked with NHS Improvement (now NHS England) to produce a dataset on
prescribing in a hospital setting which has been dispensed in the community.

The data is related to items prescribed and dispensed in England. The data only
includes items prescribed by NHS Hospital Trust Units which have been dispensed
in the community. Cost Centre data is not included in this dataset.

The data provided is based on England Hospital Trust prescribing only and may 
include items prescribed in England but dispensed in Wales, Scotland, Northern
Ireland, Guernsey, Jersey, Alderney and the Isle of Man.

The dataset excludes:

- Items not dispensed, disallowed and those returned to the contractor for 
further clarification.

- Prescriptions prescribed and dispensed in Prisons, Hospitals and Private 
  prescriptions.

- Items prescribed but not presented for dispensing or not submitted to NHS 
  Prescription Services by the dispenser
